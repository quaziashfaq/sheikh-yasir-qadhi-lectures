Title of the lecture series: Whispers of the Divine - The Art of duʿā’

Episode 1: Surah Baqarah, Verse 186

وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّى فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ

“When My servants ask you ‘O Prophet’ about Me: I am truly near.”

Our series إِنْ شَاءَ اللهُ وَتَعَالَى (Allah willing, the Most High) for this year is coming straight from Surahtul Baqarah verse 186.

وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّى فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ

This is the title of our series. "When My servants ask you ‘O Prophet’ about Me, then say to them that I am  اَلْقَرِيبُ (Al-Qareeb = The Near One)."

So our series this year will be about Allah سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى (hallowed and exalted) being اَلْقَرِيبُ(Al-Qarib = The Near One) especially when it comes to our duʿā’ to our etiquettes of how we invoke Allah and to using the names and attributes of Allah through our دُعَاءِ (duʿā’). Now the question arises why discuss duʿā’ in this month of Ramadan. The response is this very verse which Allah سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى mentions the concept of duʿā’.

It actually occurs in a very interesting location. In the whole Quran, only one time Allah mentions the month of Ramadan. Only one time Allah mentions the fast that you must do and that is in Surah Baqarah the second juz -- the three aayat before this one and the one aayat after this one are all about Ramadan and fasting.  This verse occurs smack in the middle of a context where at first glance it doesn't make sense. Three verses before this Allah سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى says “Oh you who believe! Fasting has been prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those who are before you”.

And Allah سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى says a limited number of days and Allah سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى says the month of Ramadan. This is the only time Ramadan is mentioned in the whole Quran.

The month of Ramadan is the month in which Allah has revealed the Quran so whoever witnesses this month, let him fast this month and let him finish the number of days and let him praise Allah سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى for having guided him to Islam.

The verse after this one is about the etiquettes of fasting and to eat and drink until you can see the real dawn and then stop eating and drinking.

Right in the middle, Allah عَزَّ وَجَلْ (mightly and majestic) has this verse: وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّى فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ "When my servants ask you about me then they should know I am اَلْقَرِيبُ (Al-Qareeb). I am the one who responds to the duʿā’ of the one who makes duʿā’ when he makes duʿā’.

أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ ۖ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لِى وَلْيُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِى

Let them respond to me and let them believe in me so that they may be rightly guided.

So let us for today do a brief تَفْسِيْرٌ (Tafsīr or explanation) of this aayah (آية) and then every single day we will do another aspect of the aayah of duʿā’ and the etiquettes of duʿā’. Allah سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى says وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّى -- and when my عِبَادِ (servants) ask you about me. He doesn't say 'if' or 'in'. He says وَإِذَا, 'when', meaning it is inevitable that in the journey of worship every single worshipper will want to know the answer to this question:  “Is Allah listening to me?" "How will Allah reply to me?" 

وَإِذَاسَأَلَكَ

Whenever my عِبَادِ ask you about me. And notice Allah calls us عِبَادِ —- and عِبَادِ is the worshipper of Allah. And He عِبَادِ ascribes to himself.  When my worshippers, عِبَادِى, and this is an ascription of honour. Allah is claiming ownership. Allah is saying these are my people. Allah is elevating our ranks when we worship Him. عِبَادِ is different than عَبِيْدٌ (servants) and different than عَبْدٌ. The word عَبْدٌ means slaves and عِبَادِ means worshipper.


Generally speaking, in the Quran, عِبَادِ is used in a ﺷَﺮَﻑٌ, in a matter of honour.  
Allah is ascribing honour to those who worship Him. When those whom I have selected, when those whom I have honoured, who are worshiping me they are mine. I have chosen them. وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّى So, oh worshipper of Allah! When you worship Allah, Allah سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى has chosen you to worship Him. Allah has already honoured you when you choose to worship him because you will never worship Allah unless Allah has honoured you to do that worship.

The mere act of worshiping Allah elevates your rank and Allah says these are my people -- وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّي -- when my عِبَادِ (worshippers) ask you, O Prophet (يَا رَسُوْلَ اللَّهُ), about Me. 

Now all of you have heard this as well and I'll reiterate,  the Quran has over a dozen times: they ask you (يَسْاَلُوْنَكَ), they ask you (يَسْاَلُوْنَكَ), they ask you (يَسْاَلُوْنَكَ), and every single one of those times Allah says “Reply to them يَا رَسُوْلَ اللَّهُ (O Prophet), reply to them قُلْ” except in this one verse -- the only time in the whole Quran in which it is said when they ask you and then Allah says —- he doesn't say reply to them —- Allah replies directly in the first person. There is no other time in the whole Quran in which Allah says they're asking about a حِلَّ (solution), they're asking about <??>, they're asking about <??>, قُلْ respond, يَا رَسُوْلَ اللَّهُ (O Prophet).

Only in this aayah, وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِيْ عَنِّيْ -- when my عِبَادِ (worshippers) come to you يَا رَسُوْلَ اللَّهُ (O Prophet) and they ask you about Me, Allah replies directly. He removes the intermediary (Prophet Mohammad (صَلَّى ٱللَّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ)) that we must believe in but when it comes to دُعَاءِ (duʿā’), there is no intermediary; when it comes to دُعَاءِ (duʿā’), it is direct to Allah and so Allah replies directly back to us: when my servants come to you يَا رَسُوْلَ اللَّهُ (O Prophet), I am close. He doesn't say go tell them I am close. He replies directly to me and you.  He is speaking to you directly in this verse and He is saying, فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ  "Know oh Servants of Mine! Know for
certain that I am الْقَرِيبُ ("The Near One" or "The Close One").

And notice the name that He chose. He didn't say I am As-Samiʿ (ٱلْسَّمِيعُ) (The All-Hearing).  He didn't say I am Al-Mujib (ٱلْمُجِيبُ) (The responsive One or the Answerer of prayers)

He is ٱلْسَّمِيعُ. He is ٱلْمُجِيبُ. But the word, الْقَرِيبُ, the name, الْقَرِيبُ, over here implies much more than hearing, much more than replying.

Allah is saying, I know how you're feeling, I know your affairs, I am close to you, I am with you. So with الْقَرِيبُ, you not only get ٱلْسَّمِيعُ, you not only get ٱلْمُجِيبُ, you also get رَحْمَةٌ (mercy), you also get شَفَقَةٌ (compassion), you also get حلم (forbearance, patience, gentleness, or clemency), you also get protection. 

Allah is with us. Allah knows us. Allah loves us. Allah cares about us. Allah says, "I am with you oh my servant. You are never alone. You are never alone. I am with you from the beginning and I am with you at the end.  فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ Never lose hope from me. Never feel I am distant from you. Allah is addressing each and every one of us directly and he uses the name قَرِيبٌ and the word قَرِيبٌ or the name قَرِيبٌ only occurs twice in the Quran and both of them in the context of دُعَاءِ (duʿā’). 

In the other verse, Allah says in (Surah Hud, 11:61)

إِنَّ رَبِّي قَرِيبٌ مُّجِيبٌ


My رَب is قَرِيبٌ and مُّجِيبٌ. This is in surah Hud and in this verse فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ. In both of the verses the word قَرِيبٌ occurs in the context of duʿā’. Why? Because generally when we raise our hands  to Allah, we are worried, we are already in a state of anxiety, we're through some trouble, we have some issue and pressure. So we raise our hands to Allah. We're feeling worried and Allah says, "Don't worry I am with you". إِنِّى قَرِيبٌ.

 أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ ۖ
 
I reply to the دُعَاءِ (duʿā’) of the one who makes duʿā’ when he makes duʿā’. 

Notice how many times. Allah could have said "I reply". But 'No'. He wants to emphasize and notice he wants to emphasize -- what? -- he didn't say "I reply to you" because replying to you sometimes indicates I'll take care of you once. Allah says, "I reply to every request you make when you make that request. Every petition, every duʿā’, every ask that you make. أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ. He didn't say I reply to you because reply to you, one letter comes, he's replied. No. I reply to every single letter you send me, every petition, every duʿā’, I will reply directly." 

 أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ ۖ
 
And we will explain this later on in the month.

Oh Muslim! Every time you raise your hands to Allah properly, know that Allah will reply to your duʿā’. This is not me speaking. The Quran is unconditional. The first person, Allah, is speaking to you directly. (Allah says) Know that that I will reply to your duʿā’ not once to your duʿā’, every time you make duʿā’, every time you raise your hands, every time you petition me, every time you ask something I will reply to you directly.

أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ ۖ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لِى وَلْيُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِى

The word اِجَابَ here has three meanings. We very quickly go over them. Number one: let them obey me and we're going to talk about this as well of the ways -- to get your duʿā’ answered be obedient to Allah. Number two: let them obey the etiquettes of duʿā’ -- فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لِى -- let them make duʿā’ properly.

And number three and this is very profound and the great mufassir of Andalus, Ibn Ashur, he mentions, -- فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لِى  means Allah says [أُجِيبُ and فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا۟] I will reply so let them petition for my reply. فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ can also mean let them petition to get my اِجَابَ. In other words, I'm handing out responses, let them ask for the response and they will get
it.

فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لِي

The اِجَابَ is there. You just have to ask for it.

فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لِى وَلْيُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِى

And let them believe in me. 

So believing in Allah and expecting Allah's answer is one of the most assured ways to get our duʿā’s replied to.

 لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْشُدُونَ

So that they can be rightly guided. And insha-Allah we will continue every single day talking about how to make duʿā’, the etiquettes of duʿā’, maximizing the efficiency of duʿā’, and then using the names of Allah in our duʿā’s. May Allah accept all of our duʿā’s.
